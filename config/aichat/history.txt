Tabs vs buffers in vim?
What is the benefit of tabs if I can switch buffers?
So it seems like vim has almost all the functionality of tmux except that with tmux I can persist my set up for next time
Say more on the advantages of tmux when I already use vim?
If I open a new tab in vim and I open a terminal in that tab using :term I get the same window splitting right?
I don't use session sharing, I don't really need to keep sessions alive, vim does all the window splitting i need, vim is also customizable. Are there any advantages of tmux left that could convince me to incorporate it?
